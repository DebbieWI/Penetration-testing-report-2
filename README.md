# Penetration-testing-report-2
I played the role of an independent penetration tester hired to perform security tests against their CEOâ€™s workstation. 
The CEO claims to have passwords that are long and complex and therefore unhackable. The task was to gain access to the CEO's computer and using a Meterpreter session to search for two files that contain the 'strings recipe' and 'seceretfile'.
  * Attacking machine was Kali Linux 
  * Target machine was Windows OS
  * The Metasploit tool was used in this exercise
